// 45 Events: link
// A good website is a responsive website. The user does something—clicks a button,
// moves the mouse, presses a key—and something happens. JavaScript gives you many ways to
// respond to the user's needs. A few examples:
// The user clicks a button saying "Our Guarantee" and an alert displays spelling out the
// guarantee

//  What is events
//All of these user actions—clicking a button, moving the mouse, moving from one field to
// another in a form, selecting a different option—are known as events.

// What is events handler
// JavaScript code that responds to an event—for example, displaying a guarantee or swapping an image when the
// pointer hovers over it—is called an event handler.

// What is inline events
// Inline event-handling means that you combine bits of JavaScript with HTML markup.
// Here's a line that displays a link and then displays an alert when the user clicks it.
